## 🧩 Problem & Context

Job market analysts need to answer questions like:

- 🎯 **Most in-demand:** *Which skills are most in-demand for data engineers?*
- 💰 **Highest paid:** *Which skills command the highest salaries?*
- ⚖️ **Best trade-off:** *What is the optimal skill set balancing demand and compensation?*

This project analyzes a **data warehouse** built using a star schema design. The warehouse structure consists of:

![Data Warehouse Schema](Images/1_2_Data_Warehouse.png)

- **Fact Table:** `job_postings_fact` - Central table containing job posting details (job titles, locations, salaries, dates, etc.)
- **Dimension Tables:**
  - `company_dim` - Company information linked to job postings
  - `skills_dim` - Skills catalog with skill names and types
- **Bridge Table:** `skills_job_dim` - Resolves the many-to-many relationship between job postings and skills

By querying across these interconnected tables, I extracted insights about skill demand, salary patterns, and optimal skill combinations for data engineering roles.
